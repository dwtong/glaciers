Extreme sound stretcher and harmoniser.

https://vimeo.com/551661371
*(Demo uses four samples kindly provided by @tehn in the norns default image under `dust/audio/tehn` - whirl1, whirl2, mancini1 and mancini2)*

## Features
* Stretch audio samples to the extreme, until they are almost frozen in time
* Four separate audio buffers that can be manipulated
* Add multi-octave harmonisation
* Create movement and space with panning LFO
* Based on Paulstretch algorithm 

This is my attempt to bring Paulstretch to the Norns platform. I’ve added multiple voices, harmonisation, and panning LFOs to help create multi layered dynamic textures. 

This wouldn’t be possible without the amazing work of others.
